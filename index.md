Hello!

I'm a computer scientist with particular interests in UX engineering, testing, and automation. I studied at the [University of Reading](http://www.reading.ac.uk/), and have worked both for [Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com) and in a freelance consultancy role. I am currently seeking employment beginning autumn 2014. For more details, [find me on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/evanrwilliams).

I am proficient in procedural, object oriented, and functional programming; and while I'm always happy to develop new skills, I have a good knowledge of C#, Java, Javascript (in particular jQuery), and Powershell. I am also adept in non-programming web technologies such as (X)HTML, CSS, SVG, and a variety of the more commonly used XML technologies. For a clearer idea of what I can do, take a look at [my portfolio](/code/).

I also design, organise, and run [pervasive games](/games). A selection of games I have built have been published on this site under a [creative commons licence](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/uk/) that you are free to run yourself. If you would like me to design or run a game for you as a corporate team building exercise, stag do, or other event [get in touch](mailto:evan@natcs.eu) and we'll see what we can arrange.

**Evan**
