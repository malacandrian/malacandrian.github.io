[Carnegie Mellon's Future Interfaces Group](http://figlab.com/) recently released a video in which they [identified several problems with current touch interfaces](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8s8NJf34fM). Unfortunately, while their assesment of the problem was excellent, their proposed solution was not.

The problem is that our current touch interfaces do not take advantage of the full range of expression of the human hand. They illustrate this by showing a range of grips used to interact with a selection of physical objects. This places a massive limiton on software as it reduces both the amount of information the software can give the user as well as that which user can give the software.

[Bret Victor has written extensively on this subject](http://worrydream.com/ABriefRantOnTheFutureOfInteractionDesign/).

Which makes for a good opening 40 seconds. The problems come when they introduce their solution. Essentially it comes down to taking these grips and flattening them on to the touch screen to manipulate virtual tools.

The problems are made most clear by the "mouse" tool. The main feature of a touch screen is direct interaction. If you want to interact with something, you touch it. This tool gives that up to emulate abstract manipulation with a mouse, except now you have no haptic feedback and your hand is covering the entire screen.

The amount by which this misses the point is astounding, which is surprisng [given how good some of CMUFIG's other work is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLQtqTpZBOU). But it's not just that this one tool is bad, it's that the idea doesn't achieve what they think it does. 

This is still pictures under glass, this is still a set of arbitrary guestures to controll actions. The guestures Apple standardised might not be based in reality, but they are very learnable, [and they taught everyone to use them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lZMr-ZfoE4). It fundementally doesn't matter whether your gestures are based on real world grips when they're flattened to rubbing your hand against a screen.

Metaphor and affordances are good, they help users grasp difficult concepts and learn interfaces faster but you need to know when to let go of them, when you are artifically limiting your interface with the metaphor. Here that seems to be the case right off the bat.

But even that isn't my main problem with it. My main problem with touch tools is its lack of ambition. They're trying to sell it as a great revolution that will change the way we interact with our touch devices, when all it's doing is replacing a menu.
