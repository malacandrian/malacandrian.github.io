quote: See, their morals, their code&#58; it's a bad joke. Dropped at the first sign of trouble. They're only as good as the world allows them to be. I'll show you. When the chips are down, these, uh&#133; these civilized people, they'll eat each other. See, I'm not a monster; I'm just ahead of the curve

My Brother in law was  given Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy on Blu-ray for Christmas, so we've been watching through them the past few days. I've only ever seen them fairly spread apart before, so it's been a good opportunity to watch them all together, especially now I know the plot as a whole: the patterns that form across the series are much more evident, and I've never realised how much the earlier films set up for the final one.

One of the major themes across the course of the film is how people act when order is removed: are people naturally good, or without the threat of law do we tend toward evil? Order is so ingrained in to our society that it would need to be utterly broken down before we see this play out. It's why you see the theme explored so thoroughly in post-apocalyptic fiction: it's the perfect opportunity to see what we become when there is only chaos.

And so that is what happens here, albeit on a the scale of a city, rather than the world. In each film the plan is to remove the constraints of their order: be it sanity, safety, or enforcement; and allow the city to destroy itself. While the films focus on a small group who seek to hold order and do what is right, it seems Nolan has a very low view of humanity as the masses seem always to head for evil. The plans fail, not because people are better than the villains expect, but because Batman stops them.

Where the humanist would tell you that people are fundamentally good, and the libertarian would argue that if we only removed the shackles of government the world would be for the better, Nolan disagrees. Nolan sees a world where people constantly act for their own gain, and are only stopped by the threat of law. And I agree with Nolan.

The Bible teaches that God created the world and all that fills it, and all that He created - including mankind - was good.

>Then God said, "Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness; let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the air, and over the cattle, over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth." So God created man in His own image; in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them. Then God blessed them...Then God saw everything that He had made, and indeed it was very good.

[Genesis 1: 26-31](https://www.youversion.com/en-GB/bible/114/gen.1.26-31.nkjv)
 
But it didn't stay like this for long, because man broke things: he rebelled against God, and he was rightly thrown out of paradise. Ever since then the image of God in which we were created has been corrupt. We are no longer inherently good, but rather love evil. The bible describes us in this state as lovers of the darkness

>And this is the condemnation, that the light has come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil. For everyone practising evil hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his deeds should be exposed.

[John 3:19-20](https://www.youversion.com/en-GB/bible/114/john.3.19-20.nkjv)
 
This is not to say that all people will do everything wrong all the time. This is not even to say that only Christians can exhibit nice qualities. God through His common grace has chosen to spare us such an extent of horror at this time, but man is fallen, and it is the law and order imposed upon him that stops them from committing their worst intentions. Given the safety of darkness, if they think nobody will ever find out, they will do the horrible. I believe part of what will make hell so terrible is that man will be left to his own selfish desires without restriction for eternity.

But that is only half the story. To end there would be to do you a disservice. God hasn't left us here, he isn't allowing us to continue in this self-destructive path. He intervened marvellously in history some 2000 odd years ago, as we have just celebrated, and turned us around. He promises to change those who are willing such that they once more desire good and order. To Christians, to those who have accepted this change, he says

>"You are all sons of light and sons of the day. We are not of the night nor of darkness."

[1 Thessalonians 5:5](https://www.youversion.com/en-GB/bible/114/1th.5.5.nkjv)
 
Put a load of people in a room, each under their own authority and you have hell on earth. Put a load of Christians in a room, still under their own authority and I imagine there will be a similar result. Put a load of Christians in a room under God's authority and you have something much closer to heaven.
