"O Brother, Where Art Thou" is without a doubt one of my all-time favourite films: I've always been a huge fan of the Coen Brothers, and suspect this may be the first of their films that I ever saw.  They have an outstanding sense of humour that shines through in to almost all of their work, and this is no exception. It has the rare quality of remaining funny across multiple viewings, and not in the Pythonesq laughing in anticipation of the joke manner either. But where the Coens really shine is their ability to make serious points through the comedy. So often it seems one has to choose between creating something funny and something with lasting impact, but they've managed to hold on to both which is, in and of itself, laudable.

It's a retelling of Homer's Odyssey set in Mississippi. I've not read the original, therefore I don't know how much was from the source as opposed to  their invention, perhaps one of my more educated friends can enlighten me on this.  It tells the story of of three hapless criminals who escape the chain-gang in pursuit of $1.2M. Throughout the course of their journey the consult a blind oracle, fight cyclops, and become the latest pop sensation.

This is probably the most explicit showing of the brother's nihilism. For a start, the main thread running through the piece is one of choice: be it McGill's preference of pomade, which mayor to elect, which man Penny should marry, or even which ring they should marry with. These choices are shown to be of utmost importance to the people involved, but ludicrous to those looking on. The characters are also shown to rush in to them far faster and with many times less consideration than a choice with the weight these claim demands. While all of these demonstrate these themes to some extent I'm going to focus on the pomade as I think it shows them best.

Across the course of the film, McGill's belief that Dapper Dan is the hair treatment of choice is shown to be

- Exclusive - McGill favours Dapper Dan even to the point of self-denial. He is so convinced that it is the best hair treatment that, given the choice between a competitor and nothing he will leave his hair unstyled.
- Irrational - The previous point is one of the strongest illustrations of this one: he cares more about the manner by which his hair is styled then  whether it is styled at all.  This is now of a scale far larger than it ever should have been: as much as I prefer Coke to Pepsi, if I am in the mood for a refreshing caramel-coloured drink I do not consider going thirsty an option. Ultimately any pomade would provide some hold, it might not smell the same, but it serves the same purpose.  And when the flood comes at the end it couldn't care less whether it was a stockpile of Pop or Dapper Dan that it rips through, it barely even matters that it's hair wax at all.
- Destructive - Not only is it the smell of McGill's hair that allows the police to track them,  but he also needs to be stopped from heading into a police encampment to retrieve his supply. This obsession has clearly become personally damaging.

If we then frame this with what I view as the three most important scenes of the film:

1. The baptism of Pete and Delmar, and the meeting of Tommy.
2. Pete discovering there is no treasure.
3. The police hang the four.

We can see what the directors were trying to get at. The first and the third serve to frame the entire piece, while the second is the centre point of the film (as an interesting aside, this is a structure more common to Hebrew storytelling than Western. I wonder if this was deliberate given the subject matter, or simply a holdover from their Jewish upbringing).

At the beginning Pete and Delmar, upon seeing a mass-baptism decide they want to get involved. Once again, this is shown to be poorly thought through and the two do not understand its ramifications (for instance, McGill needs to explain that while it might settle them with the Lord the State of Mississippi feels otherwise). Shortly afterwards they stumble across Tommy, a man who has recently sold his soul to the Devil. Cut now to the end, wherein all four:  two claimed by God ,one by the Devil, and one unaffiliated;  stand in front of the noose. The message here is clear:  it doesn't matter what you do in life, what your religion,  everybody dies.  They weren't just talking about pomade, they were saying that every human decision -  especially the ones we think transcend this life -  achieve nothing.

But that's not the bite of their message, that comes in the central scene: Pete discovers that there never was any treasure, that he escaped prison with just two weeks left of his sentence to chase something that didn't exist. They will add fifty years to his time for this, he has wasted his life chasing a lie. That's the real message here: that because nothing matters, especially not religion, those trying to sell it are defrauding you of your one chance of life to serve an ulterior motive.

I can see the attraction of such a philosophy: not only does it absolve one of responsibility of actions, but there is also a certain haunting beauty in it. Hard to quantify but certainly real. I could (and probably will) spend an entire post looking at the value of this viewpoint, and where it is lacking, but I don't currently have time to do so. Suffice to say, it leaves us emptier even than the void it promises: it robs us of our grief and tells us we had no reason to expect otherwise. It provides no answers and no comfort, other than to say that eventually your suffering will end, and nothing will replace it.

It should go without saying that the Bible does not share this opinion with the Coens.  It speaks of a better, more fulfilling way, in which our decisions now have eternal consequences. It says your pain, suffering, and grief are real; and that you are right to feel them. Then it goes one better: it offers a solution.  Not a "one day you won't exist any more so what does it matter" solution,  not even a "Heaven is going to be so great we'll forget about now"solution,  but a genuine answer.

It tells us of a personal saviour, a God who became man and suffered the same as us. Not only opening the way back up to Him for when we die, but also providing a relief now.

>"In coming into our world he came also into our suffering. He sits beside us in the stalled car in the snowbank. Sometimes he starts the car for us, but even when he doesn't, he is there. That is the only thing that matters. Who cares about cars and success and miracles and long life when you have God sitting beside you? He sits beside us in the lowest places of our lives, like water. Are we broken? He is broken with us. Are we rejected? Do people despise us not for our evil but for our good, or attempted good? He was "despised and rejected of men." Do we weep? Is grief our familiar spirit, our horrifyingly familiar ghost? Do we ever say, "Oh, no, not again! I can't take any more!"? He was "a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief." Do people misunderstand us, turn away from us? They hid their faces from him as from an outcast, a leper. Is our love betrayed? Are our tenderest relationships broken? He too loved and was betrayed by the ones he loved. "He came unto his own and his own received him not." Does it seem sometimes as if life has passed us by or cast us out, as if we are sinking into uselessness and oblivion? He sinks with us. He too is passed over by the world. His way of suffering love is rejected, his own followers often the most guilty of all; they have made his name a scandal."

That's what I need when I'm hurting:  not to be told that I have no right to feel that way, not even to be told that eventually everything will turn out all-right, but to turn to the one who already suffered there, who knows what it is I feel, and find solace in His company.
