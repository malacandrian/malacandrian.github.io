Stories are one of my great loves. I love hearing them, I love telling them, some days I might even go so far as to say that I collect them. As such, the plot of this film captivated me from the first moment. It tells the parallel tales of a father who created a vast mythos in place of his life, and a son trying to unpick the truth of it and discover who his father was.

We find that Edward Bloom, the father, has told these stories so often and with such vigour that they have become something extra. It is not that they have become him, it is more than that: he has become them. Meanwhile, his son chases the reality: convinced his only chance at reconciliation with his dying father lies in working  the fact from the fiction. Like all great magic tricks, however, this secret is never revealed.  The only answer we get the question of how much truth was in there comes right  at the end, at his funeral, and that is "more than you'd expect". But that satisfies us still, because the point was never to learn what was real, but to learn who Bloom was, and in the end we learn that because of, not in spite of his stories.

This film raises a lot of interesting topics, such as reconciliation and the value of truth, but today I would like to focus on a small exchange that appears just at the end of the second act.  Earlier in the film Bloom stumbles across a town called Spectre which appears to him to be paradise, but unwilling to settle down and cease his adventures he leaves again. Upon his return many years later, he realises what his departure did to the place.

>A man sees things differently at different times in his life. This town didn't seem the same now that he was older.
>
>A new road had brought the outside world to Spectre, and with it, banks, loans and debt. Almost everywhere you looked, people were bankrupt.
>
>Two different corporations were  looking at buying the town, if they could get the price low enough. One wanted to open a chicken processing plant. The other, a municipal dump. Either way, Spectre would be destroyed.

So Bloom concocts a plan: in order to save the town he destroyed he will buy it. He wouldn't demand anything off the townsfolk, after all what did they have that he could need? His only wish was to have it returned to the paradise of his memory.

>Whatever he bought, the people were not asked to leave or pay rent or anything. They were just asked to keep doing as they were doing. In that way, he could make sure the town would never die.

This seems a fantastic offer: for a saviour to sweep in, save us from our latest mishap at no cost to us, then leaving again allowing us to carry on as we were. The only trouble is the final part, that which seems most attractive at first glance: to stay as we were is not to be saved at all. The problem spectre had was not an external one, you cannot just put band-aid on it and move on, it exists at the very heart of the town, it is the people themselves that are broken.

To the man who finds himself continually unable to pay his bills, the latest final demand is not the ailment but the symptom. Equally the banks did not bring the greed with them, they merely provided a conduit by which it might be seen. put simply: if nothing changes, nothing has changed.

And Jenny notices the emptiness in offer that Bloom himself missed:

>**Edward**: I'll offer you more than it's worth. And you know you won't have to move. Nothing will change except the name on the deed, you have my word.
>
>**Jenny**: Now let me get this straight. You'll buy the swamp from me, but I'll stay in it. You'll own the house, but it'll still be mine. I'll be here, and you'll come and go as you please to one place or another. Do I have that right?
>
>**Edward**: In so many words, yes.
>
>**Jenny**: Then I don't think so Mr. Bloom. If nothing is going to change, I'd just as soon it not change in the way it hasn't been changing all this time.
>
>**Edward**: It's not like you're going to lose anything. You can ask anyone in town. I've been nothing if not generous. I want the best for everyone.

She doesn't miss the need, she sees the greater one. She wants things to actually change, not just to feel better about her current situation. she wants a relationship with her Saviour.These are not things Bloom can offer her, and he tells her that.  She ends up ultimately unsatisfied because of it.

But all is not lost, while the film may not offer us an answer to life's deeper problems, but Jesus does. upon purchasing our lives He doesn't let us carry on back toward the ditch we insist on driving into. He continues to work in us, changing us to be more like Him.  And He communes with us as He does so.

>What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin that grace may abound? Certainly not! How shall we who died to sin live any longer in it? Or do you not know that as many of us as were baptised into Christ Jesus were baptised into His death? Therefore we were buried with Him through baptism into death, that just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life. For if we have been united together in the likeness of His death, certainly we also shall be in the likeness of His resurrection, knowing this, that our old man was crucified with Him, that the body of sin might be done away with, that we should no longer be slaves of sin. For he who has died has been freed from sin. Now if we died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with Him, knowing that Christ, having been raised from the dead, dies no more. Death no longer has dominion over Him. For the death that He died, He died to sin once for all; but the life that He lives, He lives to God. Likewise you also, reckon yourselves to be dead indeed to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus our Lord. Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body, that you should obey it in its lusts. And do not present your members as instruments of unrighteousness to sin, but present yourselves to God as being alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness to God. For sin shall not have dominion over you, for you are not under law but under grace.

[Romans 6:1-14](http://www.youversion.com/bible/rom.6.nkjv)

The salvation Jesus offers is not empty like Bloom's, it does not let us simply slide back in to the comfortable self-destructive habits of our former lives. To return to my prior example, his offer is not to pay off one set of bills and hope we get back on track, it's not even just to pay off all the bills as they come in. Just as the character of this example is trapped by the want to continue buying more things, and therefore has no interest in stopping; we, in our natural state have no interest in reunification with God. Therefore, His offer is to change our wills, to fix us so we desire Him once again.

In the film, Jenny does what any reasonable minor character would do and succumbs to the protagonist's will after a little resistance, but when he leaves all the Good he did disappears with him, and Jenny's house once again fades from this

To this

And the empty salvation achieved nothing.
