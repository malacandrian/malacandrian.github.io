This has not been a good week.

From the [horrific attack on the LGBT community in Florida](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-36511778) to the [genocide of the Yazidi people in IS-controlled Iraq and Syria](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-36547467), from the murder of [a policeman and his wife in Paris](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-36535078) to [two women in Liverpool](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-36517780), from the [two year old eaten by an aligator](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-36538751) to the [murder of Jo Cox MP](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36550919). Not to mention our personal heartbreaks that is no less real for not having made the paper. We have lurched ceaselessly from atrocity to tragedy and back again. We are shocked. We are mourning. We are broken.

What are we supposed to do in the face of such pain? How do we muster the courage to turn the next page in the newspaper? Do we try to reassure ourselves that, [relatively speaking, worldwide violence is at an all-time low](https://www.ted.com/talks/steven_pinker_on_the_myth_of_violence?language=en)? Do we try to ignore it and hide in the crossword puzzles until it all blows over? Do we try to make it mean something - using the horrors to overcome the horrible?

Where is God in this broken world? What can the Christian say to such horrors? Where is our hope?

This is one of the key questions the book of Revelation answers. It was written at a time when, by all accounts, the world was falling apart. Rome was burning, Jerusalem had been levelled, and Christians were being massacred by Nero. God lifts up the curtain, and takes John behind the scenes of world history, into the very throne room of God, and shows him all that is to happen.

> After this I looked, and behold, a door standing open in heaven! And the first voice, which I had heard speaking to me like a trumpet, said, “Come up here, and I will show you what must take place after this.”

[Revelation 4:1](http://www.esvbible.org/Revelation%204:1/)

What must take place after this - in other words, it doesn't end like this. There is a better ending to come. Over the coming chapters we see that God is anything but absent in this broken world. We will see Him present as, among other things, the one who suffers alongside us, the one who judges, and the one who restores. But first, we see that God is worshiped in a broken world.

>And the four living creatures, each of them with six wings, are full of eyes all around and within, and day and night they never cease to say,
>
> “Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord God Almighty, who was and is and is to come!”
>
> And whenever the living creatures give glory and honor and thanks to him who is seated on the throne, who lives forever and ever, the twenty-four elders fall down before him who is seated on the throne and worship him who lives forever and ever. They cast their crowns before the throne, saying,
>
> “Worthy are you, our Lord and God,	to receive glory and honor and power,	for you created all things,	and by your will they existed and were created.”

[Revelation 4:8-11](http://www.esvbible.org/Revelation%204:8-11/)

John has been whisked away to Heaven where he sees God the Father ruling from His throne. Surrounding the throne there are these incredible, indescribable creatures who are constantly crying out in worship. And whenever the creatures worship (which is always) the entire people of God (represented by 24 elders) throw down everything they have before the Father and join in.

How do you imagine the Father on His throne here? I want to cast Him as a decadent ancient emperor: decadently reclining on the throne, fanned by palm-fronds, fed peeled grapes, the worship serving only His ego. I imagine this, I see Him distant and uncaring, and it disgusts me. But I am wrong in this. That is not the God of Revelation, it is the God of my imagination, and I need to repent of inventing Him.

The reality of the situation is wonderfully opposite to my imagination. I imagined God as passive and self-serving on His throne, but God is not reclining - He is ruling. He is not ignoring our situation, He is commanding it. He is getting His hands dirty. That's why John has been invited behind the scenes: to see how God is commanding and directing all of human history, including our present perils.

That's all well and good, I think to myself, but what about the worship? Isn't it a bit much? Couldn't God just put that on hold until He's sorted everything out? But again, I am wrong. The worship is not God feeding His ego. Rather, it is showing us something very important: while everything is falling apart down here, when we look into Heaven, everything is still perfect. We are made for lives of worship and preaching, and when we look in to Heaven that is what we see. The whole people of God, preach to each other of the amazing works and person of God - of His creation and His eternity - and when they hear this they give everything to this incredible God.

This is life as it was always meant to be, and that means that no matter how bad things are getting here on Earth, our sin hasn't broken Heaven. Down here our cause looks hopeless: sin corrupts and spreads to everything it touches, nothing is without its stain. But sin cannot win. It has already lost. And the incorruptible Heavens prove it.

So when the papers are this bad, what hope do we have? What gives us the courage to keep turning the pages? Where is God in our broken world? Revelation has the answer. We know that God is neither panicked, nor uncaring, but ruling over it all. We know that sin doesn't have the last word. And, most importantly of all, we know it doesn't end like this.
