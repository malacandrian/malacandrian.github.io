Moneyball is the second of Aaron Sorkin's hagiographies. The first being 2010's The Social Network, and his third being the Steve Jobs biopic. Most of his TV shows also concern brilliant (albeit fictional) people, and while some dismiss such characters as [high-class Mary Sues](http://chainsawsuit.com/2012/09/17/saw-it-for-you-the-newsroom-season-2-2013/), I've always enjoyed them and don't see the tendency for author-insertion.

The film follows a somewhat fictionalised version of [Billy Beane](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Beane), the GM for the Oakland Atheletics from 1998 onward in his attempt to reinvent baseball. As with any of Sorkin's scripts, the fast-paced witty dialogue carries the entire piece. Its [final scene](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkKCNXbtmcY) is one of my favourites from any film in its beautiful simplicity and how well it rounds off all of the characters.

Throughout the film, Beane shows a single-minded determination to win the World Series. Short of his daughter there is nothing that matters more to him. The film opens on the last game of the 2001 season, as we watch this being taken away from him. From there on in his every action is to take him closer to this goal. There's a brilliant scene just after the A's claim the record for the highest number of consecutive wins, and Beane doesn't care. It's not the victory he was looking for.

>**Billy Beane:** It's hard not to be romantic about baseball. This kind of thing, it's fun for the fans. It sells tickets and hot dogs. Doesn't mean anything.
>
>**Peter Brand:** Billy, we just won twenty games in a row.
>
>**Billy Beane:** And what's the point?
>
>**Peter Brand:** We just got the record.
>
>**Billy Beane:** Man, I've been doing this for... listen, man. I've been in this game a long time. I'm not in it for a record, I'll tell you that. I'm not in it for a ring. That's when people get hurt. If we don't win the last game of the Series, they'll dismiss us.
>
>**Peter Brand:** Billy...
>
>**Billy Beane:** I know these guys. I know the way they think, and they will erase us. And everything we've done here, none of it'll matter. Any other team wins the World Series, good for them. They're drinking champagne, they get a ring. But if we win, on our budget, with this team... we'll have changed the game. And that's what I want. I want it to mean something.

In order to achieve this despite being one of the poorest major league teams he goes about it another way, buying up otherwise undervalued players to generate the most wins for the lowest cost. But his team don't buy in to it: the scouts don't like how it makes them irrelevant, and the manager cannot understand why he is being given what he sees as terrible players and being told to put them up first. Instead of playing the team how he was told, the manager tries to run it his way, and the team loses over and over and over again.

Half way through the film, Beane calls Peter Brand (the assistant GM, who came up with the idea) in to his office and suggests trading away the players the manager keeps playing instead of the ones he wants to. To this, Peter asks "But what if we're wrong?"

Do you believe this is true? That's the question Beane asks. If it's true, why are they compromising by having these guys on the team? If it's true why aren't they going all for it all the time? There is nothing Beane wants more than to win, and this is how he will win. It is only in the assurance of this truth that the team can carry forward in any meaningful way.

In his first letter to the Corinthian church, Paul encourages us to have this same single-minded determination.

>Do you not know that those who run in a race all run, but one receives the prize? Run in such a way that you may obtain it. And everyone who competes for the prize is temperate in all things. Now they do it to obtain a perishable crown, but we for an imperishable crown. Therefore I run thus: not with uncertainty. Thus I fight: not as one who beats the air. But I discipline my body and bring it into subjection, lest, when I have preached to others, I myself should become disqualified.
[1 Corinthians 9: 24-27](https://www.youversion.com/bible/114/1co.9.24-27.nkjv)

In the same way that an athlete gives up everything else to win his race, in the same way Beane cares for nothing less than a world series win, so we as Christians are supposed to give up everything else and give our entire lives over to Jesus. Just as Beane is told early on that there's no Stanford and baseball, there is no "Jesus and", we are forced to make this choice.

If that's the commitment that's being asked for, it had better be true. Paul goes on later to say that if the gospel isn't true, then Christianity is meaningless and self-defeating. If Jesus, having died to absolve us of our sins didn't rise from the grave to prove his defeat of death, if that was a lie, then everything we do is pointless.

>Now if Christ is preached that He has been raised from the dead, how do some among you say that there is no resurrection of the dead? But if there is no resurrection of the dead, then Christ is not risen. And if Christ is not risen, then our preaching is empty and your faith is also empty. Yes, and we are found false witnesses of God, because we have testified of God that He raised up Christ, whom He did not raise up - if in fact the dead do not rise. For if the dead do not rise, then Christ is not risen. And if Christ is not risen, your faith is futile; you are still in your sins! Then also those who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished. If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men the most pitiable.
[1 Corinthians 15: 12-19](https://www.youversion.com/bible/114/1co.15.12-19.nkjv)

We need  this assurance that what we believe is true, it is a good thing to demand, for without it we have nothing. But once we have it, there is no excuse for dallying, there is no compromise, there is no "Jesus and". Why would you need a backup when the main plan is true, and will work?

I'm just going to leave with a short story from Lindsay Brown's book "Shining like stars" about the power that comes in this conviction of the truth of what we preach. This story is of Amelia, a young Peruvian student whose campus is overrun with guerrillas from the [Shining Path](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shining_path).

>At that time the guerillas put up a notice on campus with a list of the people they were going to kill. As they killed them, they ticked them off, one by one. She said Christians in the student group urged them to stop the killing, but they refused and said that if Christians didn't remain silent they would kill them too. When she heard this, she was frightened for her life and said nothing about her new-found faith for two years.
>
>She went on, 'Six months ago I asked myself the simple question: Is the gospel true? If it is true, then it is worth living for, and it is worth dying for. After several month of reflection I became convinced that the gospel was true. Since then I have spoken openly of Christ, counting the cost.'
>
>I was rebuked by her testimony. In an age when it is fashionable to emphasize our feelings and our sensitivities  let's note what strengthened Amelia - the conviction that the gospel is true. When faced with difficulties, our feeling will naturally be wayward. Only a real conviction of the truth of the gospel will buttress us, hold us together, and give us confidence to press on in living for Christ. He came to give us good news, not good feelings.
