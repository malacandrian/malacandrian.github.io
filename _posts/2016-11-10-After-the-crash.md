Today I had my first major car crash. It was entirely my fault and, thank God, nobody was hurt. I'm very much still recovering, but here are my initial reactions:

### 1 - I am no better than anyone else - even by my own standards. ###

  If you want to invoke my righteous anger, then break the highway code. I dare you. It's not even road rage - I'm not angry that you got in the way, but that the system was broken. I'll quite happily get mad at you for waving me through a junction where you had priority. It's about the efficiency of the system, and above all being correct - and I can see no higher calling to which to devote my life than British traffic guidelines.

  And yet I pulled out on to a major road while my vision was obstructed. I would dock someone their driver's licence for forcing me to brake lightly as they pull across my path if I could. Yet I not only endangered other road users, but forced someone to come to a complete stop for ten minutes while we sorted insurance details, and slowed a lane of traffic as they had to navigate around our cars.

  It was me Paul was writing about in Romans 2

  > Therefore you have no excuse, O man, every one of you who judges. For in passing judgment on another you condemn yourself, because you, the judge, practice the very same things.

  Even by my own standards I am a failure. If I was the judge of my own life, I would have no choice but to declare myself guilty. In this failure I am reminded, despite my self-righteousness, it is a good thing that I am not the judge. It is a good thing that my eternity doesn't depend on my adherence to the highway code, but the love and mercy of the God who died for me.

### 2 - A quick confession goes a long way. ###

  If you read the advice on what to do when you're involved in a collision, the first thing they say is never apologise. To apologise is to admit guilt, and if you're guilty it's going to cost you. So we set ourselves against each other. Each trying to get the upper hand, all for the sake of a few pounds.

  Instead I opened with an apology. As we established in point 1: I'm no saint, this was made much easier by how obviously at fault I was. But it did defuse the situation. Instead of escalating into a shouting match and making a ruined day worse, we were able to help each other recover from the shock, and understand the insurance system.

  Confession helped again when I got home and the shame sank in. All I wanted to do was hide from the problem and cover up the damage, but there was simply no way of doing that. As soon as I went to pick my wife up from work she'd see the damage (or more realistically she'd see that I turned up in a bus). With nowhere to hide, my only choice was to admit my failure. My shame told me this was the worst thing to do, but the truth is that shame melts in the presence of unconditional love.

  If this is true between me and my wife, how much more is it true between me and Jesus? He already knows my every failure inside and out. If I listen to my shame and try to hide, it will only drive a wedge between us; but if I confess my failures, His love will melt my shame.

### 3 - A good church is a glorious thing. ###

  In the immediate aftermath, I felt terrible. I wanted to vomit and could barely speak. I didn't know what to do, but I knew I needed help, and I knew my church would be there to help me. Despite being very new to the church, despite not really knowing anyone there, when I told them my problems they leaped to my aid. They offered practical help, making sure I wasn't stranded and picking my wife up from work where I couldn't, but it didn't stop there. Rather than offering quick fixes they empathised with me, sharing my pain. And most importantly they prayed with me and preached the gospel to me.

  Christian community is one of the best things Jesus has given us, and by enjoying it today I was given a glimpse of how great eternal life will be. This is what I love about my church.
