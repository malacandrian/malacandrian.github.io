Where The Wild Things Are" is loosely based on the book by Maurice Sendak, and fundamentally about a boy having an existential crisis. His entire life seems to be spinning out of control: his parents are divorced, he's not shown to have any friends, and his family don't pay him the attention he demands. On top of all that he learns that the sun is dying, and is forced for the first time to face thoughts of mortality, that nothing in this life lasts forever. To deal with this he runs away and invents a land where he can be king and solve all of life's problems.

This is an outstanding film: first time I rented it I watched it twice through and made note to add it to my DVD collection. The cinematography is beautiful, for instance the shots of the half-constructed fort are worthy of framing.

Meanwhile the story evokes many a memory of childhood. Some good, others not. While I've never been in quite the same position as Max was, I very quickly related to him and understood his plight. It's probably because of this that this film is one of the few to have brought me close to tears.

When we first observe the Wild things they're in utter disarray: they're fighting amongst themselves, one of them has left, and another is destroying their village. Enter Max, who, in a desperate bid to avoid being eaten spins them a lie.

>Be still! You can't eat me. You didn't know, that's why I forgive you. But never try it again! I've powers from another land. From ancient times. Don't make me show you. I destroyed these Vikings once. They wear horn hats. And they are big. Bigger than all of you. One time they attacked me in my ice fortress. They tried to cave in the roof. But I made it too strong. I told them to be still, but they didn't. I conquered them. I had to make their heads explode.
>
>And then they realized that I knew all the secrets of the world.
>
>They made me their king.

Here the Wild Things realise that maybe it is a king that they lack. Perhaps a king would solve their problems. So they ask him.

>"You were their king and you made everything right?"
>
>"Yeah."
>
>"Well, you know, what about loneliness?"
>
>"What he's saying is, will you keep out all the sadness?"
>
>"I have a sadness shield, it keeps out all the sadness. It's big enough for all of us."

So they put their faith in a monarchy based on lies and false hope. And for a while it works, they happily unite around their new-found king. But quickly troubles and divisions return, and he is unable to help them, if anything he makes them worse. His big two edicts are the building of the fort and the dirt clod war, both of which fail to deliver on their promises, instead leaving great resentment between the Wild Things. Then there's the bones at the beginning, and a comment at the end that tell us Max is not their first king, but the latest in dissatisfying line.

This bears a remarkable similarity to Israel's history told throughout the Old Testament. For a long period the country had no clear leader, and this is not shown as a good thing.

>"In those days there was no king in Israel; everyone did what was right in his own eyes"
[Judges 21:25 ](http://www.youversion.com/bible/judg.21.25.nkjv)

So the people attempt to solve this problem by appointing themselves a king, but this doesn't work out so well either. Even their good kings leave much to be desired, and their bad ones leave the country in ruin. They fail to live up to the people's expectations of what a king should be, and choose to pursue their own aims ahead of the country's. They promoted a broken human to an unreasonable position and expected him transcend his inherent limitations.

And that's something this film picks up on as well. Right at the beginning when Max is declared king one of the Wild Things declares

>"I don't understand. He doesn't look like a king. If he could be king, I could be king."

The only trouble is the conclusion they draw from this. Toward the end, one of them comments.

>I don't even know if there's such a thing as a king who can do all the things you said.

Where the characters saw their failed kings and became disparaged, the failed kings of Israel were supposed to point us forward to a greater hope. While it was folly to expect any human to live up to these feelings, we have the promise of a king who can. If you look to the time of the Judges, they were in disarray not because they had no king, but because they ignored God as he was supposed to be it. When they asked for a king it says

>"And the Lord said to Samuel, Heed the voice of the people in all that they say to you; for they have not rejected you, but they have rejected Me, that I should not reign over them."

[1 Samuel 8:7](http://www.youversion.com/bible/1sam.8.7.nkjv)

God was always supposed to be Israel's king, and he seeks to restore that status with Jesus. The Magi recognised it

>Where is He who has been born King of the Jews? For we have seen His star in the East and have come to worship Him.

[Mathew 2:2](http://www.youversion.com/bible/matt.2.2.nkjv)

Even his accusers recognised it, placing the below sign on the cross they executed him on

>And they put up over His head the accusation written against Him: THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.

[Mathew 27:37](http://www.youversion.com/bible/matt.27.37.nkjv)

Finally, in a vision given to John God recognises it

>And He has on His robe and on His thigh a name written: KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS.

[Revelation 19:16](http://www.youversion.com/bible/rev.19.16.nkjv)

Not only in God do we have a king we can rejoice to follow, but he even brings us one better than the fort from the film.

>Now I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away. Also there was no more sea. Then I, John, saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. And I heard a loud voice from heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and He will dwell with them, and they shall be His people. God Himself will be with them and be their God. And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes; there shall be no more death, nor sorrow, nor crying. There shall be no more pain, for the former things have passed away. Then He who sat on the throne said, Behold, I make all things new. And He said to me, Write, for these words are true and faithful. And He said to me, It is done! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End. I will give of the fountain of the water of life freely to him who thirsts. He who overcomes shall inherit all things, and I will be his God and he shall be My son. But the cowardly, unbelieving, abominable, murderers, sexually immoral, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars shall have their part in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone, which is the second death.

[Revelation 21:1-8](http://www.youversion.com/bible/rev.21.1-8.nkjv)

I'm not about to claim that there's going to be a laboratory where we can build robots to do stuff for us, and I doubt we'll need the private detective agency, but doesn't that sound like the kind of place where only the things you want to have happen happen? And I'd argue that the standards for entry are even higher than just cutting out the brains of people we don't like. I certainly don't meet them on my own merit. Fortunately, therefore it is on Jesus' merit that I will be judged for entry to this new creation.

One of the brilliant things about this movie was to show a kingdom run on the whim of a child, after all we can all see the idiocy of eating ice cream and chips for every meal or never going to work, we can see that the fort would never do what he claimed it would; but we like to think our follies are subtler. After all, we've grown up now, we're wise to such things. But when we see the poor ways in which genuine adults run the world, maybe rather than thinking about what a better job we could do we should instead look forward to what a better job God will do.
