title: How is a programmer like an alchoholic?
short-title: Ultimately Helpless

I was just reading an interesting thread on [Slashdot](http://slashdot.org/) about [what it takes be a programmer](http://developers.slashdot.org/story/12/09/16/1631239/can-anyone-become-a-programmer) when this very interesting comment popped up

>There's something else that's a significant barrier for most people: Pretty much every successful programmer will tell you about their first lesson when trying to write some small programs, and their discovery that no matter how hard they tried, their first efforts always had bugs. They quickly discovered that this was a permanent part of programming, accepted it, and studied debugging techniques.

>But most people can't get past this problem, because they can't admit to themselves that they will never be able to write a significant chunk of code without error. **The good programmers are the people who can admit that they're hopelessly fallible**, face the fact, and learn how to deal with it.

That really struck me, how in one of the most arrogant and self-aggrandising communities I've come across - and I say that as an equally culpable member of the community - this guy has identified that it's the humility to admit that we screw up that really makes a programmer.

It bears more than a glancing similarity with the opening Alcoholic's Anonymous' 12 steps

>1. We admitted we were powerless

I always find it amusing when I see parts of life echoed in others like this. It really helps enforce the centrality of certain ideas. Because ultimately admitting you're hopelessly fallible isn't just a requirement for a programmer,  it's not just an essential step for dealing with addictions, but it's ultimately the answer to life itself. You see Bill and Bob got that from somewhere, you can see it when you look at the second step (and the only other one I can list off the top of my head).

>2. Came to believe that a power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity.

It's echoed further down the list again. The thing about powerlessness, and hopeless fallibility is that by definition it's not just a matter of bucking yourself up; were it you wouldn't be powerless. You can't dig your way out of a hole, you need someone else to throw down the ladder, and when the rest of humanity is down there with you it doesn't leave many options.

The bible tells us we were built for union with each other, and with God, and that things start breaking down when we go off and try and run things without him. We were built incomplete, in need of something more. Trust me when I say this: it's a feature, not a bug. So much so, that even Jesus himself bore it.

>Then Jesus answered and said to them, "Most assuredly, I say to you, the Son can do nothing of Himself, but what He sees the Father do; for whatever He does, the Son also does in like manner".

[John 5:19](http://www.youversion.com/bible/john.5.19.nkjv)

Our requirement to be in union with God comes from the very image of God himself that we bear. How cool is that?
