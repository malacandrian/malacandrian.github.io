  title: Hello!
---
I’m Evan Williams. I live in Norwich with my wife and a very excitable Labrador, and would love it if you considered me for your next vacancy. I have experience and training in both technical and people-focused roles. I think analytically, learn quickly, and work creatively.

Most recently, I worked for [Bishop Hannington Church](http://bhmc.org.uk), training in church leadership. This involved a wide range of responsibilities including teaching, managing teams of volunteers, and aiding in the day-to-day running of the church. I taught in many different contexts: [sermons for the adults in our main gatherings](http://www.bhmc.org.uk/sermons/?preacher=73) (listen to examples [here](http://www.bhmc.org.uk/sermons/?preacher=73), or on the player below), discussions and talks for international students, or developing teaching material for 11-14 year olds ([this is a copy of the material I produced to help them memorise Mark’s gospel](/resources/files/mark-experiment.docx)).

I worked as a software tester for [Microsoft](http://microsoft.com), where I held responsibility for running and analysing their automated tests. Each morning I would look at the several-thousand test results we generated overnight to what went wrong, and who was responsible. For example: was it a bug in the product, or the test? Was the testing environment set up correctly? Was the test appropriate for the hardware we were using? Achieving this required spotting patterns across failures (both from today and historically), recreating the test conditions in a controlled environment, and searching through large log files. Once the tests had been analysed, and those responsible had been advised, I would invest time in building tools and streamlining processes to improve productivity.

I trained in Computer Science at the [University of Reading](http://www.reading.ac.uk). I studied, among other topics, software testing, image analysis, and user interface design; and am familiar with a range of object-oriented and functional languages. For my final year project, I built on Jef Raskin’s work in the [Humane Interface](http://amzn.to/2dwhPqF) and on the Canon Cat to develop an alternative interface for desktop and tablet computers. Once completed, I presented the work at a local tech gathering in Reading. More details, along with other projects can be found in my [programming portfolio](/code/).

I also design, organise, and run [large-scale games played across a town centre](/games/). A selection of games I have built have been published on this site under a [creative commons licence](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/uk/) that you are free to run yourself. If you would like me to design or run a game for you as a corporate team building exercise, stag/hen do, or other event [get in touch](mailto:evan@williams.ee) and we’ll see what we can arrange.
