##Piccolo.NET
[View on Github](https://github.com/malacandrian/Piccolo.NET)

Piccolo.NET is a library for creating 2D zooming user interfaces. It was originally developed by the [University of Maryland](http://umd.edu/), before being spun off as a [separate project](http://www.piccolo2d.org/). I started using it for my final year project, but found it lacking in features (in particular it had a significantly smaller feature set than the Java version), and to be an abandoned project (with the last update in 2005).

As such, I have continued development to match my required feature set, and have released all [changes on my Github](https://github.com/malacandrian/Piccolo.NET) under the same BSD licence as before.
