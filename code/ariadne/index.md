##Ariadne

[Ariadne](https://github.com/malacandrian/Ariadne) was my final year project at the [University of Reading](http://www.reading.ac.uk). Named after the Greek myth in which Ariadne helps Theseus escape the Minotaur's labyrinth, Ariadne aims to help free user's from labyrinthine file structures, and computers that work against the way they think. It was produced as an alternative to the WIMP GUI found on most desktop operating systems, building on the work of Jef Raskin in the [Humane interface](http://amzn.to/2dwhPqF).

Find the [full project on Github](https://github.com/malacandrian/Ariadne), and the [report written about it here](/resources/files/ariadne.docx).
