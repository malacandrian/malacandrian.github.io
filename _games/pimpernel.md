_Paris, 1792._

Gentlemen,

I trust you are aware of the current situation in France. Due to the revolts, many of our brethren are threatened by the guillotine. With her Majesty&#39;s government refusing to have any involvement in these matters it has fallen to us to free them from such an unfortunate fate.

Yours,

The Scarlet Pimpernel

###Premise

The League of the Scarlet Pimpernel is a game of people smuggling. The League of the Scarlet Pimpernel are trying to get French aristocrats safely across the border in to England without being detected by revolutionary forces.

###Set up

2. Two players are selected to be the NPCs. They will stand at each end of the map to count scores.
3. The remaining players are divided in to one defending team _(The Revolutionaries)_ and a number of attacking teams _(The League)._

     The defending team should have at least as many players as the largest attacking team. The attacking teams should be the same size where numbers permit. With 10 or 11 players only have 1 attacking team, with 12+ have 2.
4. One NPC goes with the attacking teams to one side of the map _(France),_ the other goes with the defending team to the other side of the map _(England)._

###Play

1. Each attacking team privately nominates an aristocrat
     The attacking team can choose to change who is their aristocrat at any point when the entire team is assembled at France.
2. Attacking players are isolated agents in enemy territory, so cannot use their phones to communicate. The defending players are part of a large network with many informers, and therefore can communicate by phone.
2. The attacking teams must attempt to move their aristocrat from France to England while evading capture
     - The VIP can only move while being escorted by another player
     - The other player does not need to be from their team. If a player from another attacking team starts escorting the aristocrat, the aristocrat must follow.
     - The defending team can approach and arrest anyone they suspect of being an aristocrat.
     - The arresting officer then escorts the attacking player back to France. If they were the aristocrat, the attacking player must wait 2 minutes before returning to the game.
     - The attacking team may eliminate a defender by tapping them on the shoulder without the defending player knowing that they are there.
     - If the defending player notices an attacker trying to sneak up on them, they only need to say their name out loud to stop the attack.
     - No running is allowed. All captures must be performed by outmanoeuvring the opponent, not outpacing them.
3. An attacking team scores a point whenever they escort an aristocrat from any team to England.
     When they reach England, the team must go all the way back to France before they can begin another run.
4. The defending team scores a point whenever they successfully arrest an aristocrat.

###Balance

In a well-balanced game there should be 1 point scored (that is, an aristocrat successfully escorted or arrested) once every 10 minutes. About as many points should be scored by the attackers as defenders.

If this is not the case, you have several tools for adjusting the game balance. The first is changing how many people are on each team. The second is adjusting the size of the play area. A larger area favours the attacking team as they have more routes they can go through, so if the aristocrats are being caught too frequently increase the size of the play area. If they are being escorted too frequently reduce the size of the play area.
