				<p>As a current student of computer science at the <a href="http://www.rdg.ac.uk">University of Reading</a>, I operate Retroactive Decisions in my spare time, offering my talents in <a href="dev.htm">development</a> for reasonable rates. I'd be delighted if you considered me for your next job.</p>
				<p>I am profficient in procedural, object oriented, and functional programming; and while I'm always happy to develop new skills, I have a good knowlege of Java, Javascript (in particular jQuery), Powershell, C, and C++. I am also adept in non-programming web technologies such as (X)HTML, CSS, SVG, and a variety of the more commonly used XML technologies. Additionally, I have industry experience in software testing and automation.</p>
				<p>I operate <a href="projects.htm">several projects</a> further to my computing skills 
				including marketing, events management and pervasive game design. As a member of <a href="http://rucu.co.uk">Reading University Christian Union</a> I coordinated the publicity campaign for the largest event of the calendar in my first year, then organised and ran its equivilent in my second year. The event itself consists of a week in which over fifteen individual events averaging over 20 attendees each, with the best attended having more than sixty. I also design, organise and run pervasive games, having done so on several occasions with two different rule sets for 30+ and 12+ people respectively created in association with a friend that I hope to publish soon.</p>
