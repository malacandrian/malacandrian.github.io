title: Spoiler Warning

Occasionally I will post here discussing a film/book/game/etc. The purpose is not to review the artefact, but to discuss it and the points it is trying to make. While I will not be deliberately ruining the endings of films/books/games/etc for the sake of it, I do not consider them off-limits: after all, if the ending were not important in the telling of the story, the story would end earlier.

I thoroughly recommend seeing/reading/playing the artefact before reading my bit on it; because if it wasn't worth doing I wouldn't be discussing it.
