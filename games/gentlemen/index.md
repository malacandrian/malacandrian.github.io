###Premise
The aim of the game is to smuggle a series of very conspicuous objects across a populated area without getting caught. With each completed run players can choose to cash in their points, or gamble and go for much higher score.

###You will need
 - A myriad of pots, pans, and other reasonably obvious objects
 - Two large, ridiculous, inflatable objects. ([These are a favourite](http://www.elc.co.uk/Inflatable-T-Rex/138588,default,pd.html))

###Set up
1. Stick a score card to each object that needs to be smuggled.
1. Two players are selected to be the NPCs. They will stand at each end of the map to count scores.

3. The remaining players are divided in to one defending team and a number of attacking teams.

     The defending team should have at least as many players as the largest attacking team. The attacking teams should be the same size where numbers permit.
4. Each NPC takes an attacking team and approximately half the objects to each side of the map. The defending team set up in the middle.

###Play
1. Each attacking team takes a number of objects from the NPC.

     They can have up to 3 objects in play at any one time, and can take objects from either NPC (assuming the NPC has any left)

     They are allowed to take an inflatable at most once every 15 minutes. The inflatable is worth double points.
2. Each attacking team must attempt to move the objects from one NPC to the other.
     - The objects can be passed between players, one player may have at most one object at any one time and objects cannot be left unattended
     - If a defending player is able to get within touching distance of a player they must surrender their object. Once a defending player has the object they must immediately take it to either NPC and cash it in for points.
     - No running is allowed. All captures must be performed by outmanoeuvring the opponent, not outpacing them.
3. If an attacking team member successfully gets the object to the next NPC, the NPC signs the score card to indicate a run was completed. The player can then either cash in the object for points, or risk another run.
     - The object is worth geometrically more points for each run completed. The points values are *1* -1, *2* -3, *3* -6, *4* -10, *5* -15, *6* -21
     - After 6 runs the object must be cashed in
     - An inflatable object is worth twice as many points
     - If a defending player captures the object, they score the number of points the object would have been worth had it completed the run (e.g. If no runs have been completed, 1 point. If 4 runs have been completed 15 points).
     - When an object is captured or cashed in the score card is removed and saved for scoring, and a new one is attached so the object can be reused.
4. Only defending players are allowed to communicate by mobile phone
