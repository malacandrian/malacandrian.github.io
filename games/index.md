This is a collection of pervasive games I either developed or co-developed. They have all been released under [CC-BY-NC-ND](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/uk/) meaning you are free to take and play them. If you do play one, please [get in touch](mailto:evan@natcs.eu) and let me know how it went. Alternatively, if you want to design or run a game for you or your event [get in touch](mailto:evan@natcs.eu) and we'll see what we can arrange.

The games have been designed to be played in urban environments such as town centres or shopping malls. An ideal play area should be fairly small and contained with a large number of routes between any two points. The area should also be fairly busy with lots of people so that players can hide in the crowd to slip past one another.

Because the games are played in crowds, and not everyone necessarily knows each other, it is recommended that you have a clear way of identifying players. We tend to use brightly coloured feathers attached to either the hair or the hat of each player.
