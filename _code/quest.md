Quest is a text-based adventure game written for the Javascript console. To see it in action, press F12 and look at the console.

All the verbs are provided in the form of a Javascript function attached to the window object, which the user can call to interact with the game. Nouns take the form of arguments passed to the verb.

Quest was inspired by [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org)'s console Easter egg

I'm a big fan of hiding things in plain sight, and rewarding curiosity; and I wanted to see how much further I could run with their idea. The game itself is fairly simple: it mostly exists to explore the idea of running a game from the console - a natural new home for this classic genre if there ever was one - but my hope is that everyone who stumbled across it got at least a moment's enjoyment from their discovery.
